# Hexapod
This is my personal fork of the original phoenix hexapod code written by KurtE.
It has been changed to work with phoenix clones from china, these are significantly cheaper, but use cheaper servo's with inverted logic. They are also slightly bigger. Therefore, I have made changes to the Hex_Cfg.h file to make the inverse kinematics work better on the phoenix clone.
